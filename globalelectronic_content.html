<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>
    The objectives of this project are simplified and stated as follows: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>To develop a unit-specific analytics dashboard to support decision-making across different units,</li>
    <li>Identifying top-performing products by revenue and profit,</li>
    <li>Analysing revenue and profit growth trends,</li>
    <li>Evaluating market performance by region,</li>
    <li>Profiling high-impact product and customer segments, and</li> 
    <li>Highlighting operational bottlenecks, delivery, and logistics issues</li>
</ol>
<h3>Discovery and Presentation of Insights</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Developed a 5-page dashboard consisting of Executive Summary, Product Performance, 
        Customer Analysis, Sales Channel Performance, and Delivery & Logistics Analysis.</li>
    <li>Filtering by year, in 2018, Adventure Works Desktop PC233 led in both revenue and profit.</li>
    <li>Revenue, units sold, and profits peaked in 2018, followed by a decline likely impacted by the COVID-19.</li>
    <li>North America (U.S. & Canada) emerged as the strongest market for Global Electronics Retailer.</li>
    <li>Champion customers and Best Seller products contribute the most to business performance, therefore, 
        these segments require priority attention and retention strategies.</li>
    <li>Despite fluctuations in average order value, in-store sales consistently outperformed online sales 
        in revenue, often by more than 3x.</li>
    <li>Online sales channel has critical delivery issues. Only 7.23% of orders were delivered on time in 2016, which is a major problem for both online marketing and delivery/logistics units.</li>
    <li>Also, critical delays (>90 days) cluster in Q1 each year, showing the need to pay attention to this period.</li>
    <li>The Contoso brand and Home Appliances product category recorded the highest delivery delays as 
        indicated by the delivery severity index (DSI), a metric that quantifies the severity and frequency of delivery delays.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    This project demonstrates how thoughtful data engineering and visual storytelling can drive strategic 
    decisions in product management, customer segmentation, channel optimisation, and logistics performance.
