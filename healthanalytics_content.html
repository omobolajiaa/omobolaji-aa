<h2>Health Analytics of Patients</h2>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Tools: SQL, Power BI, DAX</p>
<p>
    This one-page interactive dashboard explores patients' hospital utilisation patterns and insurance
    coverage within Massachusetts General Hospital using synthetic data from 2011 to 2022. Developed in 
    Power BI, the project intergrates clinical and financial dimensions to illuminate how patients engage
    with hospital services and how insurance coverage impacts access and cost. The visual design emphasises
    user experience, enabling dynamic exploration of key trends and patient-level details through interactive
    filters, slicers, and toggles.

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>
    The primary goal of this project was to develop a data-driven tool for healthcare stakeholders -
    including hospital administrators, policymakers, and insurers to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>monitor trends in hospital admission, readmissions, and procedure-related costs,</li>
    <li>evaluate insurance coverage distribution and financial access,</li>
    <li>identify disparities in utilisation across age groups and patient profiles,</li>
    <li>enable patient-level exploration for care pathway analysis,</li>
    <li>gain insights into the quality of healthcare provided to patients</li>
</ol>
<h3>Discovery and Presentation of Insights</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Designed a dynamically interactive dashboard that reveals the current state of hospital services, 
        utilisation, and financial implications for patients per year selected</li>
    <li>Monthly admission and readmission trend reveals of year 2014 showed that more patients were admitted
        from end of Q3 while readmission trend for the same period was undulating and peak during Q3. This 
        shows that the quality of medical care received by patients in 2014 is likely below standard as 
        readmission tends to continue gaining momentum.</li>
    <li>The dashboard also showed patients' health insurance coverage is slightly above one-third which implies
        that most of of the treatment are out-of-pocket treatment.
    </li>
    <li>Most of the patients admitted in 2014 are within the age of 51 - 90.</li>
    <li>Malignant neoplasm of breast and primary small cell malignant neoplasm of lung are the two reasons for 
        patients' admission and readmission in 2014.
    </li>
    <li>Bulk of patients aged between 71 and 90 live with malignant neoplasm of breast disorder in 2014</li>
    <li>The dashboard also showed that more than half of the number of patients with malignant neoplasm of breast 
        and primary small cell malignant neoplasm of lung do not have their health insurance coverage.
    </li>
    <li>Lastly, majority of patients with no health insurance coverage falls within the 51-70 age group followed 
        by 71-90.</li>
