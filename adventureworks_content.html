<h2>Adventure Works Analytics</h2>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Tools: Excel, SQL, Power BI, DAX<hr /></p>
<p>
    This is an insightful project that utilises various technical tools in developing a clean 
    dashboard that answers stakeholders of Adventure Works business questions. KPIs required to provide
    solutions to business problems were developed appropriately and visualised using appropriate visuals.
    The project solution is segmented into two dashboards. The first offers an Executive Overview 
    of the business and the second gives the Sales Team a tool to optimise their marketing strategy to boost
    revenue and profit for the business.

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>
    The primary objective of this project is to support Adventure Works Company in making informed, data-driven strategic decisions.
    This is done by developing a dynamically-interactive dashboard that will aid both the Executives and Sales Team of the company, 
    therefore, the following objectives are set to be achieved:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Reveal the annual and monthly trend of revenue of the company,</li>
    <li>Evaluate the profitability and growth of the business,</li>
    <li>Identify the Top 5 product sub-categories with by revenue and profit,</li>
    <li>Reveal the top performing market of Adventure Works based on revenue generated per market,</li>
    <li>Identify top performing resellers and products</li>
    <li>Identify clearance sales products of the company</li>
</ol>
<h3>Discovery and Presentation of Insights</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The annual revenue trend across all years exhibits a consistent seasonal business cycle, with revenue 
        peaking in the second month of each quarter and reaching a trough at the start of each quarter.
    </li>
    <li>In 2018, there was a positive YoY change in revenue, profit, unit sold, and orders but negative profit margin YoY.
        However, there was a sharp drop in gross profit and profit margin in June, indicating increased costs or pricing pressures 
        despite higher sales.
    </li>
    <li>With the dashboard filtered to 2018, Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes are leading product sub-categories with the highest revenue.
        Moreover, being among the Top 5 highest grossing revenue product sub-categories does not imply highest profitability as some 
        sub-categories with high revenue may have lower profit margins due to higher costs or discounts. In fact, Road Frames and Mountain 
        Frames are the most profitable sub-categories.
    </li>
    <li>Insight generated from the visualised data shows that the Unitted States remain the largest market of Adventure Works and both US 
        and Canada dominates its market share.
    </li>
    <li>In terms of revenue generation, resellers such as Retail Mall, Vigorous Exercise Company, and others showcase good market performance, 
        moreover, the business incurred loss from these resellers while resellers such as The Gear Store, Brakes and Gears, Great Bikes, etc. 
        are profitable as of the year 2018 considered. This mixed performance could be due to the clustering of clearance sales products in 
        some resellers store while other resellers have a handful of them. For instance, Farthermost Bike Shop has a gross profit YoY %change 
        of -1260% because of the numerous clearance sales products in its shop.
    </li>
    <li>The clearance sales products of Adventure Works account for almost one-third of its entire products.</li>
